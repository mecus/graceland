                    <li>
                        It is important that you bear in mind that the level of service to be provided will have a direct impact on the costs of your case. This may affect our ability to pursue your case or the amount you have to pay, as we have discussed.

                    <li>
                        Unless you advise us to the contrary, we will assume that we have your authority to take all steps that we consider reasonable in the conduct of your matter and incur other expenses (known as ‘disbursements’ e.g. Fees paid to the Court, Land Registry or Expert Witness). We shall of course inform you in advance if unusual or high expenses were to be incurred.

                <h1>Charges And Expenses</h1>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                        Our charges are based on the time we spend in dealing with a case. Time spent on your affairs will include meeting with you and perhaps others; any time spent travelling; considering, preparing and working on papers, correspondence and making and receiving telephone calls.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The current hourly rates of our solicitors and fee earners unless otherwise agreed, are as follows: -
                        <ul>
                            <li>Principal:  £180.00</li>
                            <li>Other Solicitors:	£150.00</li>
                            <li>Trainee Solicitors: £120.00</li>
                            <li>Others:    By agreement </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Routine letters that we write, and routine telephone calls that we make and receive will be charged at 10% of the hourly rate of the solicitor acting for you. For example, if a senior solicitor is working on your file at a rate of £180.00 per hour and writes a routine letter, the charge for this will be £18.00. Long letters (exceeding one A4 page) and long telephone calls will be charged on a time basis at 50% of the hourly rate. For example, if a senior solicitor working at a rate of £180.00 per hour spends an hour writing a long letter on your behalf, the fee for writing this letter will be £90.00. Routine letters received will be charged at 3 minutes per item. If your instructions mean that we have to work outside normal office hours, we reserve the right to increase the level of the hourly rates. You will be notified in writing of any increased rate. File opening is charged at £25.00. The minimum charge on any matter is £60.00.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The charge rates are reviewed from time to time to take account of changes in our overhead costs and we will notify you in writing of any increased rate. Please also note that the amount of costs which you will have to pay may be greater than the amount you can recover from another party to the case.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In addition to the time spent, we may take into account a number of factors, which include complexity of the issues, the speed at which action must be taken, the expertise or specialist knowledge which the case requires and, if appropriate, the value of the property or subject matter involved. You will be charged for the time that a Senior Solicitor or the Supervisor/Principal spends considering or amending and finalising the work prepared by the other members of staff but it will still be cheaper for you than if the senior solicitor/supervisor/Principal did absolutely everything themselves on your case. Based on the information currently available, we expect these factors to be adequately covered by the hourly rates set out above. The rates maybe higher if, for example, the matter becomes more complex than expected; we will notify and provide you with further clarifications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There may be certain other expenses (‘disbursements’), including payments we make on your behalf, such as Court/Tribunal Fees, Medical Report Fees, Inquiry Agents charges and Barristers fees, which you will have to pay. VAT is payable on certain expenses. There are other minor disbursements such as bank charges, land registry fees, Courier delivery, Travel costs and large quantity of photocopying, Facsimile or E-mail transmissions (sent or received) and archiving. We will ask you to pay these on account (i.e. before we incur them), which is normal practice. All disbursements will be shown separately on your Bill of Costs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We will inform you if any unforeseen additional work becomes necessary (for example, due to unexpected difficulties or if your requirements or the circumstances significantly change during the course of the matter). We will also inform you of its estimated cost in writing before any extra charges or expenses are incurred.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Payment on Account: - It is normal practice to ask clients to pay sums of money from time to time on account of the charges and expenses which are expected in the following months or weeks. This helps to avoid delay in the progress of their case.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Interest: Graceland Solicitors Ltd will pay you interest on the money you pay to us on account of costs and expenses until  it is used unless it is a relatively small amount or is used within a short time of receipt.

                    <li>
                        We will send you an interim bill for our charges and expenses at intervals of six months at least, while the work is in progress. This enables you to budget as the matter progresses. The bills we send out while we are still working on your case are not an exact costing of the full amount due. They do broadly cover some or most of the work done but the full cost is calculated at the end of your case. We will send a final bill after completion of the work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When we send you a bill, the amount you have to pay will be transferred from our client account in your name to our “office” account which holds our own funds. If your account remains in credit the balance stays on our client account in your name. If there is not enough money to pay an expanse or our bill, we will ask you to pay the balance promptly and we may also ask you to pay a further amount to be held on our client account in your name.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Payment is due to us within 14 days of our sending you a final bill. We will charge you interest on the bill at 4% above the base rate of Lloyd’s Bank from the date on which payment of our bill is due, if you do not pay our bill within this time. Interest will be charged on a daily basis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We understand that sometimes it is easier for people to pay bills than at other times. If you have difficulty in paying for the work as I do it, please do speak to the person who is dealing with your case straight away. You should tell us if your financial circumstances change and we will do our best to develop the right payment plan for you. We cannot work for free but we will try to assist you.

                    <li>
                        Many people have legal expenses insurance and you should check your mortgage, your housing/contents insurance, even car insurance to see if you have it. If you have insurance, you are entitled to choose your own solicitor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You may also be able to get funding from your (or your partner’s) Trade Union or the Equality & Human Rights Commission for cases involving employment/discrimination issues.
                    </li>

                        A conditional fee agreement allows a solicitor to offer what is called a “no win, no fee” arrangement when taking on new cases. In other words, the solicitor can offer the client a fee structure which means that while they will receive a success fee if they win the case, if their case should be unsuccessful then no fee will be charged. However, solicitors make the decision on taking on such cases based on several factors. These can include their experience, either as an individual or as a firm, in dealing with similar cases. Another factor is the likely duration of the case. Obviously, the longer a case drags on, the more expensive it is for all concerned and a solicitor will normally prefer cases that are less time-consuming. The other main factor that a solicitor will take on board when deciding on whether to offer a client a conditional fee agreement is the chance of winning the case. If your case is successful, then your lawyer’s costs will normally be paid by the other side, and this will include a “success fee” for your solicitors. However, it is important to understand that if you are not successful you may be required to pay part or all of the costs, not just of your lawyers, but potentially also of the other side’s legal team. It should be noted that not all firms offer Conditional Fee Agreements and they are not applicable to certain types of cases (e.g. family proceedings and most criminal proceedings).

                        Legal aid (Public Funding) is a scheme administered by the Legal Aid Agency, and is available to help people pay the cost of most criminal cases and many types of civil cases with exceptions including libel, most personal injury cases and cases associated with the running of a business. To qualify for Public Funding in civil cases, there are two issues on which the Legal Aid Agency will have to be satisfied. First, that you have reasonable grounds of proceeding with the case (i.e. you have a reasonable chance of succeeding and enforcing any judgment or order against your opponent) and that it is reasonable to grant Public Funding in the circumstances of the case (i.e. a reasonable fee-paying client of moderate means would pay a solicitor for the work requested). Secondly, that your financial circumstances are such that your disposable income and capital resources fall within the limits prescribed by the relevant regulations.

                        A “lien” means the right to hold someone else’s property as security for a debt. If you do not pay our bills, Graceland Solicitors Ltd may have the right to hold onto your paperwork as security for the outstanding costs. This also applies if you decide to change solicitors, where there are costs outstanding. In practice, Graceland Solicitors Ltd will release your papers to your new solicitor if a satisfactory undertaking as to the unpaid costs is given

                        You have a right to know how much you are likely to have to pay Graceland Solicitors Ltd and should never feel uncomfortable about asking. We hope you will understand why it is often difficult for us to give precise estimates of how much part or all of your case will cost or how long it will take. If you ever want to know anything about costs, all you need to do is ask us.

Graceland Solicitors Ltd also has our own complaints procedure and if you remain dissatisfied, in certain circumstances, you may ask the Law Society or the Court to assess whether or not the costs we have asked you to pay are reasonable. Please ask if you would like further details of these procedures

                        Just as we will do our best to achieve the most favourable outcome for you, we will try to ensure that as much as possible of your own legal costs is paid by the other side. In the civil court, such as the County Court or High Court, the general rule is that if you win, the other side will have to pay your costs. However, the other party may not be ordered to pay all your charges and expenses or these may not be recovered from them in full; if this happens, you will still have to pay the balance of our charges and expenses. If the other party is legally aided, you may not get back any of your charges and expenses even if you win the case.

                    <li>
                        If you are successful and the court orders the other party to pay some or all of your charges and expenses, interest can be claimed on them from the other party from the date of the court order. We will account to you for such interest to the extent that you have paid our charges or expense on account, but we are entitled to the rest of that interest.

                    <li>
                        You will also be responsible for paying the charges and expenses of seeking to recover any charges and expenses that the court orders the other party to pay.

                    <li>
                        In some circumstances, the court may order you to pay up the other party’s legal charges and expenses; for example, if you lose the case. The money would be payable in addition to our charges and expenses. We will discuss with you whether our charges and expenses and your liability for another party’s charges and expenses may be covered by insurance, and if not, whether it would be advisable for you to have insurance to meet the other party’s charges and expenses.

                        Sometimes we ask other companies or people to do [typing/photocopying/other work] on our files to ensure this is done promptly. We will always seek a confidentiality agreement with these outsourced providers. If you do not want your file to be outsourced, please tell us as soon as possible

                        We may decide to stop acting for you only with good reason, for example, if you do not pay an interim bill or comply with our request for a payment on account. We must give you reasonable notice that we will stop acting for you.

                    <li>
                        If you or we decide that we should stop acting for you, you will pay our charges up until that point.
